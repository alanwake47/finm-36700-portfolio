    "### Quadratic Option LTCM\n",
    "- LTCM has negative beta to spy-squared, thus short the market options.\n",
    "- SPY-beta is delta and SPY-squared-beta is gamma.\n",
    "- LTCM is short positive gamma and since gamma is always positive, they are shorting the market.\n",
    "- For a big monthly return, the negative beta to SPY-squared would lead to heavy losses. Thus, LTCM is shorting SPY-squared options, to hedge extreme moves in the market."
