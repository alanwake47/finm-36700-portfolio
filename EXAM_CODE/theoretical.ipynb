    "### About LTCM\n",
    "- LTCM traded on market mispricing and arbitrage opportunities.\n",
    "- They go long-short on Relative Value and Convergence trades.\n",
    "- Use leverage to get bigger principle on mispricings.\n",
    "- Heavily involved in credit and income and equities.\n",
    "- Longest trading horizon is in convergence - weeks to months.\n",
    "- Not short term either\n",
    "- Seek small positive wins. Lower skewness than SPY. Susceptible to large losses.\n",
    "- They were efficient at financing and funcding along with prop trading and modelling.\n",
    "- Larger AUM so higher leverage\n",
    "- Pay lower haircut, better collateralization\n",
    "- Long term capital commitment from investors.\n",
    "- Avoided taking on too much risk. They almost always had liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of risk LTCM\n",
    "- collateral hairtcut risk\n",
    "  - value of collateral goes down\n",
    "  - LTCM fights this by using 100% financed collaterals. and stress testing haricut losses/\n",
    "- repo maturity risk\n",
    "  - When credit risk goes up, contract not able to be upheld.\n",
    "  - LTCM has long term repo\n",
    "- equity redemption risk\n",
    "  - if investors redeem during adverse times\n",
    "  - LTCM restricts redemptions year by year.\n",
    "- loan access\n",
    "  - Tough to get loans when credit risk goes up.\n",
    "  - Revolving loan agreement that has no Material Adverse Change clause.\n",
    "- liquidity risk\n",
    "  - LTCM got counterparties to maintain collateral balance via a two-way mark to market process on a daily basis. This is called a \"haircut call\" and is a form of collateral management.\n",
    "  - LTCM also estimates worst case haricut losses and stress tests them.\n",
    "  - LTCM reduces liquidity risk by adjusting security correlations.\n",
    "- leverage risk\n",
    "  - Since no extreme market events, leverage risk is not a concerns.\n",
    "  - Considering rturning some of the investments to reduce leverage.\n",
    "- convergence risk\n",
    "  - Trades dont converge after a while due to liquidity risk.\n",
    "  - Trades ultimately converge, but LTCM has to wait for it to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quadratic Option LTCM\n",
    "- LTCM has negative beta to spy-squared, thus short the market options.\n",
    "- SPY-beta is delta and SPY-squared-beta is gamma.\n",
    "- LTCM is short positive gamma and since gamma is always positive, they are shorting the market.\n",
    "- For a big monthly return, the negative beta to SPY-squared would lead to heavy losses. Thus, LTCM is shorting SPY-squared options, to hedge extreme moves in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Up Move and Down move LTCM\n",
    "- LTCM is short the call-like (up move) and long the put-like (down move) options.\n",
    "- The put-like betas are bigger than the call-like betas.(abs value)\n",
    "- LTCM is negatively exposes to the market volatility. THe negative exposure comes from a combination of the short call-like and long put-like options."

    "- JPY returns seem to be away from the expected value of 0, an improvement in the carry trade would be to short the JPY i.e. **borrow at the JPY risk-free rate to invest in the USD risk-free rate. With our forecast of the USD strengthening relative to the JPY, we could be potentially getting a positive risk premia from this carry trade**."

    "- When the market has an **overly optimistic view of future dividend**, prices would exceed fair value. Investors would then **eventually** realize they were too optimistic and that prices would rever toward **fair value.**\n",
    "- Thus at times of high prices GMO would have a contrarian view of expected returns being low.\n",
    "- GMO believed that 2012 valuations were high for stocks. They were pressimistic about future earnings growth.\n",
    "  - $\\%\\Delta(\\frac{P}{E})$ multiple was 0% in 2011, causing positive estimated returns.\n",

    "- Which form of testing a Linear Pricing Model is stricter: using the time-series test or the cross-sectional test? Explain.\n",
    "  - In the figure below, the time-series test completely fixes pricing through the black points and line, whereas the cross-sectional test fits the scatter plot more flexibly. (In the figure, it has an unrestricted intercept, but even without an intercept, it can choose any slope it wants, whereas the time-series test slope is fixed by the MKT premium.)\n",
    "  - In the CS test, the factor premia are the estimated slopes of the cross-sectional regression, whereas the time-series test requires that the factor premia are the time-series averages of the factors.\n",
    "- Why is it hard to assess statistical significance of the results of a cross-sectional regression for a Linear Factor Pricing Model?\n",
    "  - The cross-sectional regression uses time-series regression outputs (the betas) as its inputs (the regressors.) This usage of model estimates as input data introduces additional uncertainty, noise, imprecision. The usual OLS stats do not account for this.\n",
    "  - Ways of dealing with this include using Fama-MacBeth regressions or Generalized Method of Moments.\n",
    "- Suppose that the 4-factor pricing model works perfectly, but we include an extra, un- necessary 5th regressor in the model. With this 5th regressor\n",
    "  - Will the time-series test betas be impacted?\n",
    "    - Betas will be impacted.\n",
    "    - If the extra regressor is correlated to any of the 4 factors, it will impact their betas. Even if it is uncorrelated to the other factors, it still may have a non-zero beta.\n",
    "  - Will the time-series alphas be nonzero?\n",
    "    - The alphas will still be zero! (Statistically zero--an estimated sample will have some statistical noise, but they will not be statistically different than zero.)\n",
    "    - Linear Factor Pricing Models are no-arbitrage models, so the 5th factor will not introduce any mispricing, though it may confuse the attribution of the pricing.\n",
    "  - Will the cross-sectional regression slopes, (λ in the notation of our notes,) be impacted?\n",
    "    - Yes, the factor premia estimates ($\\lambda$) from the cross-sectional regression slopes will potentially be different. The time-series betas have changed, and that will potentially impact the cross-sectional regression slopes.\n",
    "  - Will the cross-sectional test errors be nonzero?\n",
    "    - Same answer as for the time-series alphas--they will still be zero! (Statistically speaking.)\n",
    "- True or False: If the Fama-French 5-factor model is true, then for a given return rti, the five factors are the optimal regressors in a replication regression of rti in terms of getting the best replication.\n",
    "    - False. The Linear Pricing Model factors are not guaranteed to be good for Linear Factor Decomposition. In other words, a great (even perfect!) LPM does not necesssarily have high time-series R-squared.\n",
    "- Suppose that you want to replicate a target return, y, using some other returns, X. If you do not trust that the means of y and/or X are well measured, should you include an intercept in the replication regression?\n",
    "  - You should include an intercept in the regression. By including an intercept, you are effectively demeaning both $y$ and $X$. Thus, if you do not trust the sample mean, you should not let it impact the regression betas, and thus should include an intercept."

    "- (5pts) In the course, we derived mathematically that high dividend-price ratios must lead to high future returns.\n",

    "- (5pts) From class and homework, we saw that the dividend-price ratio forecasts returns but that the earnings-price ratio does not.\n",

    "- (5pts) They Expectations Hypothesis assumes that there is only one priced risk: interest-rate risk.\n",
    "  - True. The Expectations Hypothesis assumes that there is only one priced risk: interest-rate risk. The other risks are not priced, and thus are not priced risks.\n",
    "- (5pts) Empirically, we found that a positive Euro-USD spread in interest rates predicts depreciation in the USD, relative to the Euro.\n",
    "  - False. It was shown that uncovered interest parity does NOT hold. In fact, using FX spreads as a predictor leads to excess returns as the currency does not depreciate away the interest rate gains.\n",
    "- (5pts) Statistically, replicating a target with instruments is the same as hedging a target with instruments\n",
    "  - True. The difference between the replication and hedge is in \"sign\" of the position. In a replication, you are long the target and short the instruments. In a hedge, you are short the target and long the instruments. But the statistical properties are the same."
